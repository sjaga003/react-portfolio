Personal website and developer portfolio for Suhas Jagannath. Includes resume, social links, and highlights of personal projects across many different tech stacks. View the live site [here](https://www.suhasjagannath.com)!

## Overview

This site was built to be a hub for all my projects and a display of my work so far as a developer. Here you can get a simple and clean glance into my journey as a software engineer.

## How I Built It

Technologies Used:

- React
- Styled Components
- Framer Motion
- Gatsby
- Netlify

## Future Developments

I hope to continue to look more into how Gatsby uses graphql, and update it with my projects as time goes on.
